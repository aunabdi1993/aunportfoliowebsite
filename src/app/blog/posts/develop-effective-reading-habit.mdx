Over the last couple of years I have spent a lot of time reading. I have always been a keen reader, but when I took the step to dedicate myself to reading consistently I saw tangible differences in my life.

I often get asked, *“How can I develop a reading habit?”* It’s a question that seems easy to answer with *“just read more.”* But like many things in life, there are nuances and perspectives that need to be taken into account. Here are some tips from my experience.

## Why are you reading?

Are you reading for enjoyment and escapism? Or are you reading to learn self-development and philosophy to change your life? Answering this question will give you more focus and direction when reading.

I always start a new book with a question in mind. This is usually reserved for non-fiction books but I sometimes do the same with fiction. For instance, I recently read *Never Split the Difference* by Chris Voss, which talks about negotiating strategies. Prior to reading this book, I was looking for practical tips to implement these strategies into practice — and I did so only a week after finishing the book (successfully, I might add!).

## When can you read?

We all lead busy lives. Reading is often a luxury that we need to savour and enjoy in between work and life obligations.

When new readers feel inspired to read, they often throw out their whole calendar to read. Although the intention may be well placed, it is not effective to maintain a consistent reading routine.

What I suggest is looking at your existing routine and finding times you can fill with 15–20 minute reading intervals. This can be while commuting, in between work calls, or during any free time. The key is to consistently implement the habit.

## Read what you enjoy

Whether you love reading romance, thriller, mystery, or self-development, reading should be an enjoyable exercise.

The majority of the books I read are non-fiction self-development books because I love to learn and implement new ideas into my life. But I also read fiction from time to time — I am currently delving into *Notes From The Underground* by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, which is proving interesting.

Don’t feel guilty reading books that may not seem “relevant,” but understand that all books don’t provide the same amount of value. Knowing this will set realistic expectations for your reading goals.

## Understand that you can’t read everything

Life would be great if we could be like Neo from *The Matrix* and plug in and download books in 15-second intervals (I’m smiling just thinking about it). Unfortunately, this is not the case.

We have to be selective with the books we read as our time is limited. There is some comfort in knowing that we can’t read it all. It makes us savour and appreciate the book we are currently reading so we can use it for our own development.

Doing so puts us in a better position to utilise the information being passed down to us from people much wiser and more experienced than us.
