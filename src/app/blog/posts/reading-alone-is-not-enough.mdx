When we read, we are constantly exploring the unknown. New ideas, thoughts, and experiences are being handed down to us by the author, often leaving us overwhelmed with information. This puts pressure on us to use this information in practice. However, often we end up short.

Readers generally fall into two camps. The first group reads for pleasure, and whatever practical insights emerge from the writing may or may not be implemented—depending on whether they are remembered. The second group (in which I am a member) systematically goes through a book looking for ways to improve their life. If you’re reading fiction alone, this discussion is arbitrary, but if you read non-fiction, the first group might need to re-think their strategy.

When a non-fiction book is written, its aim is to inform, educate, and provide knowledge based on the experience of the author. The author supplements this with stories to back up their experiences, solidifying their argument and giving the reader more reasons to take the message seriously. When this is done well, the reader is left with the impetus to take action and find ways to use this wisdom in practice.

The issue comes when this wisdom is left un-actioned. In the past, I read many books and was left questioning what I was going to do with the information given. This happened so frequently that I began questioning the purpose of my reading habit. Was it for education and personal growth? Or was it merely for the sake of reading? This is when I knew I had to make a change.

After deliberating on this point for quite some time, I found that asking myself a simple question before starting a book actually helped: *“Why am I reading this?”* Simple, I know. But we often forget it. Reading with purpose is effective reading. When we know what we are reading for, the information in the book becomes clearer and easier to use to our advantage.

As John C. Maxwell once said:

> “A wise person learns from his mistakes. A wiser one learns from others’ mistakes. But the wisest person of all learns from others’ successes.”

When we use a book to determine how to live more correctly based on our individual goals, reading becomes a rewarding exercise. And when you do this—you won’t look back!
