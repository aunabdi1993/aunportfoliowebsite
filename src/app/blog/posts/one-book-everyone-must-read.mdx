> “It is never possible for mortal men to establish absolute truth, but relative truth only.”

Rarely do I come across a book that completely alters my perspective on life. However, when it does it can feel truly transformational. A couple of years ago I read such a book and as I reflect on its impact on me, I am left wondering why more people haven’t read it.

The book is *The Gulag Archipelago* by **Aleksander Solzhenitsyn**. Born in 1918, Solzhenitsyn suffered directly at the hands of the Stalinist regime as an outspoken critic of the leadership. After enduring eight years in multiple forced labour camps, the book tells a personal account of his experience and the effect it played on the human psyche.

What becomes evident after finishing his account is that the proclivity for human evil is not far from each of us. Within the book, he muses on the idea that the guards who inflicted punishment on prisoners were not far removed from the prisoners themselves, but had been conditioned to act in such a way. Many guards, in fact, were sympathetic to their prisoners, but would never show this for fear of being made one. The lies that underpinned communism therefore permeated through the minds of all those that would inflict harm on their fellow *comrades*.

What I was left questioning was why this was not taught at school? On multiple occasions I was taught about WW2 and the Cold War from a solely historical perspective. Looking back, I realised that learning history in this way discards the level of human suffering people endured during these periods. It is in these personal accounts that psychological lessons can be learnt that extend far beyond the historical facts themselves. Not only do you learn about how and why humans perform such atrocities, but you also understand the lengths to which humans can endure suffering and maintain hope.

This is why this book is a **must-read**. Although at times the information within it is incredibly difficult to digest due to its graphic descriptions, it extends further to suggest that no matter your suffering in life, you should never degrade yourself to a level where you lose hope.

It is precisely for that reason why it must be read. We see, hear and know of suffering that occurs daily. No matter the size of the suffering, there is always something to be learnt in enduring it. By reading the lengths to which others, such as Solzhenitsyn, had suffered previously, it gives context to our own struggles in life.
