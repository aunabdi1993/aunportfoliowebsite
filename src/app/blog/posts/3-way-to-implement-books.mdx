As someone who likes to read, it’s difficult to implement everything you read as there is often too much information. What I have found is implementation starts with your ability to find what is important to you in a particular book. From there you can then implement and review. Here are 3 strategies I use to help me:

## 1. Ask yourself why you’re reading a particular book

Many people struggle to finish a book and extract as much information from it because they do not know why they are reading it. Asking yourself why you’re reading a particular book can be a great way to focus on what you’re trying to improve.

A recent example of this is that I read the book *Never Split The Difference* by Chris Voss to improve my negotiating skills. By addressing this question before starting, I was able to use the strategies in the book only a few days after finishing to my benefit.

## 2. Write down the principles you have learnt from the book

Writing gives us accountability. When finishing a book we often move onto the next book without considering how we can implement the book we have just finished.

Writing down five principles after finishing a book is a great way to take some of your learnings and put them into action. The principles can be points for further research, some quotes that inspired you or actions that you want to implement. Just by writing the principles down increases the probability that these will be put into action.

## 3. Review regularly

The last habit in the best-selling book *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People* by Stephen R. Covey is *sharpen the saw*. To *sharpen the saw* is to constantly remind yourself about the improvements that you’re looking to make in your life.

These improvements will become second nature as a result and you will become better off because of it. Schedule in a weekly review session where you can analyse your progress.
