We categorise everything into good and bad. How we define good or bad depends on our personal experiences and preferences, but it is difficult to say something is objectively good or bad.

As someone who reads extensively and reviews books, I often get asked about books I like and don’t like. This is a difficult question to answer as a book can be good for one person and not so for another. A better question to ask is, *“Who is the ideal person for this particular book?”*

I have read books written by authors which didn’t connect with me. Either their way of storytelling didn’t connect with me or the content in the book wasn’t interesting. But when I asked someone else about the same book, they would claim the book helped them tremendously. There is no difference in the book, just differences in perspective.

Your perspective is your unique way of seeing the world. We read and educate ourselves to enlighten our perspective and then use it to act in the world. We shouldn’t look at our perspective as being right or wrong, but unique. In doing so, we remain open to all the books we may read and our judgements of them.

When someone then asks you about which books they should read, your reply should be, *“What are you trying to accomplish?”* instead of listing the top ten classic self-help books. By understanding that person’s perspective, you can then tailor recommendations based on this.

When looking at books, don’t say whether they are good or bad, determine who they are ideally for. If it is not clear, then perhaps it is a bad book.
