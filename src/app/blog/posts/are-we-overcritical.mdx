When we think of success we often see the overcritical perfectionist that will not stop until their desires have been met. To be successful in your chosen field, there is a positive correlation between the quality of output and success. However, the quality of your work is defined by your level of experience.

When I started my first job I assumed, naively, that everyone had their own job figured out completely. To my despair I realised that this was a gross misinterpretation of the value that progression has in our lives. It took me some time to realise that everyone is on a journey of self-discovery of who they are and what they want. It is easy to pick out a single moment in time and be self-critical of yourself or others. This is how many of us assess ourselves and the objective world around us. However, it is too simplistic.

## The Trap of Short-Term Goals

This is why I have a certain way of seeing short-term goals. As great as I think short-term goals are, I do believe most people spend too much time planning their goals rather than taking action. This is evident during the early months of the year when budding fitness enthusiasts make plans for the year ahead. After a couple of weeks the motivation decreases and they are left wondering why. In this position the individual usually becomes self-critical of their actions often falling back into bad habits to soothe the pain. This is the cycle of life that plays out in many people’s lives. But there is another way to see it.

Instead of seeing short-term goals as a metric for success, look at metrics over time that track progress. I have become a big advocate for people changing definitions of how they see themselves in order to make positive changes in their life. A personal goal of mine is to run 100km this month. I now see myself as a runner which helps enforce the idea that I need to take my training, recovery, food and sleep into consideration if I want to make this change. The goal of 100km is not the finishing line but a metric for charting progress into the future.

## From Criticism to Progression

I am, like many people, overcritical of myself when things don’t go to plan. Anyone who is remotely ambitious would feel the same, but it is important in the moment to understand that this is just a snapshot in time. Time passes, situations change and progression is made to make your goals come to fruition. Instead, focus on putting systems in place that ensure that success is being made daily towards a wider goal. If a bad day happens, then it is just a bad day. Not a bad week, month or year.

With this understanding I believe we can all become a little less critical of ourselves.
