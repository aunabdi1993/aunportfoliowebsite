- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS  
- **Integrations**: Stripe (payments), Zoom (lessons), Google Calendar (scheduling)  

## Challenges and Learnings  

One major challenge was designing a platform that could meet tutors’ immediate needs while also being flexible enough to scale. Balancing simplicity (for onboarding new tutors quickly) with extensibility (for advanced Pro features) required careful planning of the feature roadmap.  

Another learning was around integrations: each third-party API (Stripe, Zoom, Google Calendar) came with unique authentication and edge-case challenges. Solving these required building robust error handling and fallback mechanisms to maintain a smooth tutor and student experience.  

## Outcome  

The platform is already validated with core functionality — scheduling, payments, and lesson hosting — making it possible for tutors to launch their business from day one. The upcoming Pro features will further differentiate Talim by offering automation, marketplace visibility, and integrations that support long-term business growth.
